I followed the recipe exactly and let the dough chill in the fridge for a half hour before rolling it out and using cookie cutters vs. a cookie press. I baked the cookies on parchment paper and they were perfectly done in ten minutes. These have a wonderful butter flavor and are great for decorating. When I was all done I placed them in clear cellophane bags tied with ribbon - too cute!",

            "I followed the recipe exactly the only thing I don't have is a cookie press. I'm a very experienced baker and never had cookie dough go this wrong on me! I chilled the dough for 30 minutes before trying to roll it out but it was still very gooey and sticky. It also tore far too easily and my floured rolling pin couldn't even go one stretch before tearing it apart and getting the dough stuck to the *floured* surface.   I'm sure this is a great recipe if you have a cookie press. The doug tastes delicious. I ended up pressing it out with my hands and using cutters. This obviously gives sort of ugly uneven cookies but with the amount of butter I used i didn't want it to go to waste. We'll see how they bake!  Just a warning to other cookie press-less bakers. I was hugely disappointed. It's also kind of screwed up my Christmas party as I now only have 3 hours to finish off and offer ugly cookies! Haha.",

            "This is the first time I've actually bothered to log in and write a review. Oh man, these cookies are good. Yes, you should add a little confectioner's sugar to improve the taste and add to the \"melt in your mouth\" factor, as well as some brown sugar for moisture (I added 1/8 of each, 1/4 total). I also cut down on the flour. Thanks to the other reviewers, those few tweaks resulted in a blissful butter-sugar shortbread like cookie that can stand on its own. Normally my favorite cookies have chocolate involved, but honestly, these are so delicious I don't even miss it. (Hint - because this recipe is so simple, the quality of ingredients has to be good or it will ruin the flavor. I'd bet the majority of people who had issues with this recipe didn't use unsalted real butter, sifted flour, or real vanilla extract). Seriously, if you're having a cookie craving, give these a try.

                                        After making the dough instead of using a cookie press or dropping by balls, I rolled the dough into four logs, wrapped the logs in waxed paper, placed in the fridge to harden, and then sliced in about 1/2" slices. Perfect and delicious. Sometimes I make the dough up to 3 days ahead of time then slice and bake when I need them. After baked I sprinkle with powder sugar. Makes a beauiful presentation.

                                        I followed the recipe exactly the only thing I don't have is a cookie press. I'm a very experienced baker and never had cookie dough go this wrong on me! I chilled the dough for 30 minutes before trying to roll it out but it was still very gooey and sticky. It also tore far too easily and my floured rolling pin couldn't even go one stretch before tearing it apart and getting the dough stuck to the *floured* surface. I'm sure this is a great recipe if you have a cookie press. The doug tastes delicious. I ended up pressing it out with my hands and using cutters. This obviously gives sort of ugly uneven cookies but with the amount of butter I used i didn't want it to go to waste. We'll see how they bake! Just a warning to other cookie press-less bakers. I was hugely disappointed. It's also kind of screwed up my Christmas party as I now only have 3 hours to finish off and offer ugly cookies! Haha.

                                  Excellent shortbread ccokies!! But be prepared when making these, the recipe says it makes 2 dozen and that's WAY off unless you're using some super **huge** cookie press! I get at least 6 dozen cookies out of one batch every time I make them!

                                  This recipe was very easy and came out very good. But I think the proportions are wrong, I halved the recipe and still made at least 2 dozen. I also didn't have a cookie press, so I just rolled the dough into little balls, then flattened them on the cookie sheet. Next time I plan on dipping them in melted chocolate... mmmm..

                                  Wonderful shortbread cookie! These were so easy to make and yet turned out fabulous. It's great when such simple ingredients come together to create something so delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and let the dough chill in the fridge for a half hour before rolling it out and using cookie cutters vs. a cookie press. I baked the cookies on parchment paper and they were perfectly done in ten minutes. These have a wonderful butter flavor and are great for decorating. When I was all done I placed them in clear cellophane bags tied with ribbon - too cute!

                                  I followed the recipe exactly the only thing I don't have is a cookie press. I'm a very experienced baker and never had cookie dough go this wrong on me! I chilled the dough for 30 minutes before trying to roll it out but it was still very gooey and sticky. It also tore far too easily and my floured rolling pin couldn't even go one stretch before tearing it apart and getting the dough stuck to the *floured* surface. I'm sure this is a great recipe if you have a cookie press. The doug tastes delicious. I ended up pressing it out with my hands and using cutters. This obviously gives sort of ugly uneven cookies but with the amount of butter I used i didn't want it to go to waste. We'll see how they bake! Just a warning to other cookie press-less bakers. I was hugely disappointed. It's also kind of screwed up my Christmas party as I now only have 3 hours to finish off and offer ugly cookies! Haha.

                                  This is the first time I've actually bothered to log in and write a review. Oh man, these cookies are good. Yes, you should add a little confectioner's sugar to improve the taste and add to the "melt in your mouth" factor, as well as some brown sugar for moisture (I added 1/8 of each, 1/4 total). I also cut down on the flour. Thanks to the other reviewers, those few tweaks resulted in a blissful butter-sugar shortbread like cookie that can stand on its own. Normally my favorite cookies have chocolate involved, but honestly, these are so delicious I don't even miss it. (Hint - because this recipe is so simple, the quality of ingredients has to be good or it will ruin the flavor. I'd bet the majority of people who had issues with this recipe didn't use unsalted real butter, sifted flour, or real vanilla extract). Seriously, if you're having a cookie craving, give these a try. YUM!!

                                  They really do melt in your mouth. I was surprised that so few ingredients made such a tasty little cookie. This was my first try with a cookie press and this recipe worked wonderfully, even though the directions that came with the press said to use only their recipe.

                              After making the dough instead of using a cookie press or dropping by balls, I rolled the dough into four logs, wrapped the logs in waxed paper, placed in the fridge to harden, and then sliced in about 1/2" slices. Perfect and delicious. Sometimes I make the dough up to 3 days ahead of time then slice and bake when I need them. After baked I sprinkle with powder sugar. Makes a beauiful presentation.

                              Excellent shortbread ccokies!! But be prepared when making these, the recipe says it makes 2 dozen and that's WAY off unless you're using some super **huge** cookie press! I get at least 6 dozen cookies out of one batch every time I make them!

                              This recipe was very easy and came out very good. But I think the proportions are wrong, I halved the recipe and still made at least 2 dozen. I also didn't have a cookie press, so I just rolled the dough into little balls, then flattened them on the cookie sheet. Next time I plan on dipping them in melted chocolate... mmmm..

                              Wonderful shortbread cookie! These were so easy to make and yet turned out fabulous. It's great when such simple ingredients come together to create something so delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and let the dough chill in the fridge for a half hour before rolling it out and using cookie cutters vs. a cookie press. I baked the cookies on parchment paper and they were perfectly done in ten minutes. These have a wonderful butter flavor and are great for decorating. When I was all done I placed them in clear cellophane bags tied with ribbon - too cute!

                              I followed the recipe exactly the only thing I don't have is a cookie press. I'm a very experienced baker and never had cookie dough go this wrong on me! I chilled the dough for 30 minutes before trying to roll it out but it was still very gooey and sticky. It also tore far too easily and my floured rolling pin couldn't even go one stretch before tearing it apart and getting the dough stuck to the *floured* surface. I'm sure this is a great recipe if you have a cookie press. The doug tastes delicious. I ended up pressing it out with my hands and using cutters. This obviously gives sort of ugly uneven cookies but with the amount of butter I used i didn't want it to go to waste. We'll see how they bake! Just a warning to other cookie press-less bakers. I was hugely disappointed. It's also kind of screwed up my Christmas party as I now only have 3 hours to finish off and offer ugly cookies! Haha.

                              This is the first time I've actually bothered to log in and write a review. Oh man, these cookies are good. Yes, you should add a little confectioner's sugar to improve the taste and add to the "melt in your mouth" factor, as well as some brown sugar for moisture (I added 1/8 of each, 1/4 total). I also cut down on the flour. Thanks to the other reviewers, those few tweaks resulted in a blissful butter-sugar shortbread like cookie that can stand on its own. Normally my favorite cookies have chocolate involved, but honestly, these are so delicious I don't even miss it. (Hint - because this recipe is so simple, the quality of ingredients has to be good or it will ruin the flavor. I'd bet the majority of people who had issues with this recipe didn't use unsalted real butter, sifted flour, or real vanilla extract). Seriously, if you're having a cookie craving, give these a try. YUM!!

                              They really do melt in your mouth. I was surprised that so few ingredients made such a tasty little cookie. This was my first try with a cookie press and this recipe worked wonderfully, even though the directions that came with the press said to use only their recipe.
